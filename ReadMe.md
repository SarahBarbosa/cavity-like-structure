# Evidence of Ring-Like Structure in High-Rotation Spikes Revealed by Large Surveys

When a cloud condenses on a star, the condensing star absorbs local angular momentum, leading to its rotation axis being predominantly parallel to the Galaxy's rotation axis. However, due to random movements over their lifetimes, stars' rotation axes gradually lose connection with their primordial angular momentum. This can be verified by the lack of correlation between $v\sin i$ and galactic latitude. Some studies suggest that certain stars, particularly type B stars and evolved types F, G, and K, may exhibit a weak correlation between these parameters. This raises the question: could the rotation speed of a star at a given position in the Galaxy be related to its luminosity class and/or mass? Given the critical role of rotation in stellar evolution, we decided to revisit the issue of the lack of connection between $v\sin i$ and galactic position. Unlike previous studies, our work examines the correlation between rotation speed and galactic latitude and explores a possible dependence of rotation on the “real” location of the star in different galactic planes. To achieve this, we analyzed the behavior of median rotation as a function of galactic position for a large sample of G- and F-type stars extracted from the CGS catalog in the solar neighborhood. By dividing the sample into cells of $20\times 20$ pc$^{2}$, we found a ring of high rotation peaks centered around the Sun. This was determined by analyzing the rotational speeds within confidence intervals using bootstrap and quartiles methods. These results indicate that fast rotators are located farther from the Sun, while slow rotators are closer, approximately 80 pc from the Sun. The physical origin of this behavior remains unknown, but this result seems to contradict the Copernican Cosmological Principle, which states that the Sun should not occupy a privileged position in the Universe.
