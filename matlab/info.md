# Information about the MATLAB scripts

**BSXYvsini2017New\.m**: this script generates the figures related to the bootstrap technique. 

**MapsXY2020VmagCondition.m**: this script analyzes the impact of magnitude on the distribution of *vsini*. It tries to answer the following question: if this area-based distribution is organized not by *vsini* but by *Vmag*, does the Ring still remain? Preliminary results suggest that it depends on the quartile type.

**bootrsp.m**: this is the script used to generate the bootstrap samples.

Three windows will pop up, corresponding respectively to: the side length of the square (i.e., if the area is 20Ã—20, enter 20), the size of the bootstrap sample (use 1000), and finally, enter 150 to cover an area with a 300 pc side.
